# Enterprise frontend documentation

This repository provides reusable desktop-first frontend pages and components for ERP, healthcare, school and other SaaS applications. Start here for user instructions, integration guidance, development rules and release evidence.

The documentation layout follows the [Pepbits framework documentation](https://github.com/pepbits/pepbits-framework/tree/769a4c0e267f15653ef0994bd8df7da2ef14fc42/docs). The frontend retains its own package versions, source history and deployment records. Java/Maven release identities from that repository do not apply here.

| What you need | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Understand the product and implemented feature families | [Feature catalog](features/README.md) |
| Use the Library and understand what changed | [Library user and integration guide](features/library-preferences.md) |
| Follow settings from the API to a component | [Architecture and flows](architecture/library-preferences.md) |
| Know the mandatory component, preference and documentation rules | [Development rules](development/RULES.md) |
| Add or modify a feature | [Change workflow](development/README.md) |
| Run the current checks and understand their limits | [Testing guide](testing/README.md) |
| Find the current delivery and its actual publication state | [Unreleased delivery](releases/unreleased/README.md) |
| Understand versions, patches and release acceptance | [Versioning policy](releases/VERSIONING.md) |
| Reuse release, feature and evidence templates | [Documentation templates](releases/templates/README.md) |
| Find earlier illustrated guides and PDFs | [Reports index](reports/README.md) |

See the [shared documentation lifecycle](documentation/README.md) for new pages, impact receipts, translation revisions and review requirements.

```

Existing guides remain at `desktop-clients/docs/`; their paths and screenshots are preserved. This index links to them rather than moving or duplicating them. The latest release record takes precedence over older deployment claims for the specific change it describes.

## Current status

As of 11 September 2026, the latest demo release is `20260910173632033-48931d24`. The [healthcare reference pages](features/care-page-templates.md) are deployed on both public demo sites; see the [deployment evidence](releases/unreleased/care-page-deployment-2026-09-10.md). The [current delivery index](releases/unreleased/README.md) separates current status from historical implementation notes.

The Library inventory contains 158 destinations. Runtime documentation covers 315 page registrations: 147 authored workflow guides and 168 inherited reference-only guides. The [generated backlog](documentation/backlog.json) records 1,113 authoring/translation-review items. These are individual issues, not 1,113 missing pages. Native/domain review, physical-device integration and production-service acceptance remain explicitly pending where documented. Automated validation does not certify those reviews.

Run `node docs/tools/check-docs.mjs` from the repository root to check documentation navigation, the active guide, inventory and release evidence. See [development rules](development/RULES.md) for when documentation must change.
