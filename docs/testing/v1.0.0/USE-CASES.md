# Library acceptance cases — guide 1.0.0

Stable IDs describe acceptance responsibilities, not a count of individual Vitest assertions. Consult the release evidence for execution status.

| ID | Trigger | Expected result | Evidence source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LIB-01 | Visit every Library destination | Registered page opens through its intended renderer; no uncaught page errors; shared routes remain managed | `e2e/library-preferences.ts`, inventory/static gate |
| LIB-02 | Render all named templates with compact/spacious values | Managed tables use the chosen density, wrapping, stripes and sticky-header settings | Template preference-compliance tests |
| LIB-03 | Supply conflicting local layout and locked policy | Locked layout wins and cannot be overridden locally | Template policy test; browser locked selector |
| LIB-04 | Change policy while a page is mounted, then unlock | Managed value replaces the local choice; obsolete local override is not resurrected | usePreferenceChoice regression case |
| LIB-05 | Change a locked/unavailable page-size or view control | Control is disabled; managed value remains; no prohibited host update | Template, catalog and query tests |
| LIB-06 | Select different currency/date/number preferences | Values, billing, statistics and inline read-only display use host formatters | Catalog tests, generated-example checks |
| LIB-07 | Change table settings | Computed padding/wrapping follows the preference; selected rows retain meaning; badges remain on one line | Browser table/CSS checks; shared tests |
| LIB-08 | Change independent form/result text and set radius to zero | Regions resolve their own scales and managed rectangular surfaces become square | Focused browser computed-style assertions |
| LIB-09 | Disable custom shortcuts | Query/detail custom listeners do not remain active; normal tab navigation remains available | Query test and keyboard contracts |
| LIB-10 | Select CSV or Excel, confirm query export | Export calls the shared exporter using the selected format | Query export test |
| LIB-11 | Select a clinical preview mode under a policy | Supported drawer/card/modal is used; locked inline/view controls cannot bypass policy | Query/preview tests and browser flow |
| LIB-12 | Open the six reference destinations | Each has dedicated content and no untranslated newly added keys in the tested baseline | Reference page tests; localization gate |
| LIB-13 | Copy a component or template example | Code reflects the rendered source and imports public contracts | Generated-example gates |
| LIB-14 | Add a page, change a referenced path or edit a release record | Documentation/navigation inventory gate detects missing IDs, files, required fields or invalid publication state | Documentation tool tests and static gate |
| LIB-15 | Run WebKit/native Tauri or obtain wording acceptance | Report actual environment and outcome; do not substitute another browser or catalog check | Separate acceptance; pending/blocked in current record |

Prefixes can expand for future features. Keep existing IDs stable and record changed meaning in a new guide version.

## Billing Clinic

| ID | Trigger | Expected result | Evidence source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CLINIC-01 | Convert prescription, add service, issue invoice, pay partially, refund and export | API changes persist; invoice orders cannot be billed twice; receipts/history remain visible | `e2e/clinic-billing.mjs`, clinic billing store tests |
| CLINIC-02 | Repeat a mutation or use a stale version / another tenant / read-only role | Stable operation receipts prevent duplicates; version and server permission checks reject invalid writes; tenants remain isolated | Clinic billing store tests |
| CLINIC-03 | Change a locked form layout during editing, then encounter a network failure | Effective layout changes without losing input; retry reuses the same payload and operation ID | Billing workspace tests |
| CLINIC-04 | Select whole-number display or another preferred currency | Billing monetary display/exports retain cents and API ledger currency; quantities retain number settings | Billing formatter test and real CSV/Excel download checks |
| CLINIC-05 | Use Arabic, Hindi or Malayalam | Catalog keys resolve, direction follows the language, desktop page width stays contained | Isolated Chromium language checks; native wording acceptance remains pending |

## Clinical Triage

| ID | Trigger | Expected result | Evidence source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TRIAGE-01 | Open default rail layout at 1600 × 900 | All three sections and completion action fit above the shell status bar; no horizontal overflow | Registered clinical-triage browser suite |
| TRIAGE-02 | Save, reload, complete and reassess | Draft persists; completed form locks; new assessment has blank readings; history opens previous record | Browser suite and triage store tests |
| TRIAGE-03 | Submit missing/manual choices, malformed readings, stale version, retry, wrong role or tenant | Required fields and server scope/version/permission checks apply; repeated operation has one result | Triage store tests |
| TRIAGE-04 | Change locked form navigation or retry a failed request | Effective preference wins; mounted input and retry identity survive | Triage editor tests |
| TRIAGE-05 | Select Arabic, Hindi, Malayalam and English | Keys resolve, direction is correct and desktop width stays contained | Browser suite; native wording approval remains pending |

## Clinical Consultation

| ID | Trigger | Expected result | Evidence source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CONSULT-01 | Open default English layout at 1600 × 900 | Three sections and final actions fit above the status bar | Consultation browser suite |
| CONSULT-02 | Save, reopen, complete, open history and create a new note | Draft persists, completion locks, new note is blank | Consultation API and browser suites |
| CONSULT-03 | Retry or submit stale revision, unauthorized role/scope or invalid options | No duplicate write; server checks reject invalid operations | Consultation store tests |
| CONSULT-04 | Change layout during editing or retry a failed save | Input and retry identity survive shared editor changes | Consultation and triage frontend tests |
| CONSULT-05 | Switch four languages; re-exercise triage | Labels/direction resolve, width stays contained; existing triage flow works | Consultation and triage browser suites |
| CONSULT-06 | Open the expanded sections, enter notes and vitals, save and reload | 12 tabs remain usable, fields retain values and final actions fit the tested desktop viewport | Consultation browser suite |
| CONSULT-07 | Read an old note or update with a legacy payload | Missing optional fields render empty; load does not rewrite CSV; omitted expanded fields retain prior values | Consultation store compatibility test |
| CONSULT-08 | Save an invalid vital while its panel is hidden | The vital panel opens and the invalid field receives focus | Consultation frontend test |

## OP Consultation

| ID | Trigger | Expected result | Evidence source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OP-01 | Open OP with a completed triage and refresh reference | Real API context appears; detail opens; no copying into note | OP managed browser suite |
| OP-02 | Navigate 12 sections, save/reopen/complete and review | Values persist; full-note preview includes current unsaved entries; completed history locks | OP managed browser suite |
| OP-03 | Jump from summary and apply a locked layout | Related field opens; input survives; review does not call save | OP workspace unit test |
| OP-04 | Use four languages and default 1600 × 900 geometry | Direction/width and visible primary actions match tested scope | OP browser suite |

## Comprehensive Consultation

- CC-01: Specialty changes retain entered notes; full preview includes unsaved specialty entries. Managed form navigation overrides local layout.
- CC-02: Enter diagnoses and all four order types, edit linked details, reject duplicate diagnoses and dangling order links.
- CC-03: Scores distinguish zero, missing and not-testable inputs; E/M uses two of three levels with separate bounded time comparison.
- CC-04: Failed save preserves exact retry identity. Reopen CSV-backed records, attest and sign, verify immutable controls and tenant isolation. Editing invalidates prior attestation.
- CC-05: Four-language desktop rendering, API navigation and source/version evidence remain separate from native and clinical acceptance.

## Own Settings default module

- OWN-01: Only accessible API navigation modules appear; save persists for the account/application and survives restart.
- OWN-02: Tenant default/lock wins; direct overrides and unavailable modules fail on the server. Revoked access falls back without granting access.
- OWN-03: Desktop startup and web application home use the selected module; direct web URLs remain unchanged.
- OWN-04: Preference control uses the central update flow and cannot bypass unavailable or locked settings.

## Clinical workspace update

| ID | Flow | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CW-01 | Open View bill and Edit bill | Full API invoice view; correction fields and reason; return to ledger |
| CW-02 | Save correction, retry lost response, reopen CSV | One correction; previous snapshot retained; authoritative totals |
| CW-03 | Edit paid/refunded/void invoice or stale/unauthorized request | Rejected server-side; protected UI |
| CW-04 | Switch triage/consultation rail sections and locked layout | Same master-record rail; one section; values retained |
| CW-05 | Save/reopen/complete clinical document | Existing API version, retry and immutable completion behavior retained |

## Page Library catalog

| ID | Flow | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PL-01 | Open List of pages and search | All accessible Page Library entries in API order; no self/duplicate/unrelated entries |
| PL-02 | Open code and guide for each page | Correct public-import example and localized guide; access revocation removes an open resource |
| PL-03 | Open each working page; select a billing patient from the catalog | Functional workspace and patient controls remain; developer tabs/demo header moved to catalog; shell release notice cards appear only on List of pages, never Billing Clinic or another working page |

Billing rail follow-up: the billing browser suite asserts one active section, rail label containment, closely grouped navigation items and a footer inside the desktop viewport before executing the ledger workflow.


## Documentation lifecycle

| ID | Action | Expected result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DOC-01 | Open a catalog guide and current-page Help in each supported language | Same versioned API article and language; Arabic direction; no separate guide prose |
| DOC-02 | Modify a tracked source without a receipt | Lifecycle check fails and identifies the source |
| DOC-03 | Add a page with missing/reference/placeholder documentation | Registration check fails; required sections and stable tour anchors required |
| DOC-04 | Change guide text, field rules or translated text after review | Translation becomes outdated and review becomes pending |
| DOC-05 | Modify a published snapshot | History comparison fails; a new release snapshot is required |
| DOC-06 | Run strict acceptance with pending authoring/native reviews | Strict check fails; normal checks retain the explicit inherited backlog |

DOC-01 is registered in `unified-help.mjs`; contract tests exercise source fingerprints and translation invalidation. The lifecycle checker enforces registration/history/strict acceptance. These are distinct from reviewer approval and native executable tests.

## OP Registration

| Case | Expected result | Automated scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OPREG-01 | Five steps and six care tabs stay in one page; progress and bottom actions remain visible while content scrolls. | Chromium browser journey and screenshots |
| OPREG-02 | Required identity/consent, minor representative, duplicate visits, authorization and stale versions are rejected server-side. | Focused API tests; representative/date rules require additional domain acceptance |
| OPREG-03 | Nursing review, signed immutable note, service completion, charges, payment and checkout persist. | API tests and browser journey with reload |
| OPREG-04 | Repeated operation IDs do not duplicate writes; recovery preserves input; tenant/user scope and draft exclusions apply. | API tests and injected browser network failure |
| OPREG-05 | Appointment booking rejects a duplicate provider/date/time slot. | API test |
| OPREG-06 | Four interface languages render without message keys; Arabic uses RTL; shared presentation consumes effective preferences. | Browser language checks; native-speaker review pending |

## Barcode and QR printing

- LABEL-01: Backend renders all supported code templates from file-backed records; caller-supplied payloads cannot override identifiers.
- LABEL-02: Batch copies retain physical sheet dimensions; incompatible stock is rejected.
- LABEL-03: Tenant/application/user isolation and idempotent mutation retries survive store reload.
- LABEL-04: First print records requested; reprints require allowed policy and reason; no physical success is inferred.
- LABEL-05: Payment generation/printing never marks paid; simulation requires administrator authority; expiry blocks printing.
- LABEL-06: Printer locks and copy limits are enforced in the server and frontend; preference defaults persist through the API.

LABEL-07: Save wristband stock as a personal default, then open Payment QR. A4 is selected without changing the saved default. An incompatible tenant lock remains enforced with a printer-field message and disabled generation. The API independently rejects incompatible stock with `fieldErrors.profileId`.

## Generic device integrations

- DEVICE-01: Focused scan → exact API lookup within application context; success selects record; failure keeps input; no global key capture.
- DEVICE-02: Queue persists across store recreation; same operation returns the original job; changed payload conflicts.
- DEVICE-03: Tenant/application/user/workstation isolation and administrator-only policy/rule/event changes.
- DEVICE-04: Unsupported device capability, copy limits, stale versions and changed dispatch locks are rejected server-side.
- DEVICE-05: Automatic simulation is opt-in; repeated event identity returns one job; changed record/event conflicts.
- DEVICE-06: Browser dispatch records requested only; demo dispatch is simulated; native-unavailable job stays queued; cancellation prevents dispatch. Native ticket wrapper rejects expired/mismatched acknowledgements.

## Identity devices

- IDENTITY-01: Card/passport synthetic capture shows document fields and never authenticates or updates a patient.
- IDENTITY-02: Tenant/application/operator/workstation scope and selected patient/reader binding cannot be overridden.
- IDENTITY-03: Biometric opt-in, permission acknowledgement, current reader locks and policy versions are enforced by the API.
- IDENTITY-04: Exact retries reuse requests; different payloads, expired challenges and consumed/cancelled requests are rejected.
- IDENTITY-05: Mismatch, expired document, unavailable connector and manual fallback remain distinct; raw biometric input is rejected and never stored.

## CARE-01 — Healthcare reference page templates

Verify four additive Library pages and retained OP registration. Test API-backed create/save/reload, same-operation retry, stale version rejection, user/tenant/application isolation, compatible/conflicting bed reservation, order detail retention and cancellation. Verify signed read-only fields, addenda, effective locked density and multilingual desktop layouts. Source: `care-pages/workspace.test.tsx`, `dummy-api/care-page-store.test.mjs`, `e2e/care-pages.mjs`. Real clinical integrations and native-speaker approval remain separate acceptance.

## DCP-01 — Visual template designer

Add and reorder fields/sections, edit properties, preserve stable IDs, preview validation, save and restore API drafts. Verify admin denial, tenant/application/user isolation, stale revisions, same-operation retry, effective locks, and unsupported schema rejection. Preview answers are temporary; backend DCP publication and native acceptance remain separate.

### DCP-02 — dependent dropdowns

Author Country/State mappings, preview India and UAE, preserve string IDs, clear descendants, reject forged membership/cycles/dangling parents/depth overflow, isolate draft scope and reject stale revisions. Verify late-response suppression and lookup retry. Run `dcp-dependent-dropdowns.mjs` against an isolated demo API; native and production-backend acceptance remain separate.

### DCP-03 — reusable value sets

Create shared sets and relationships, retain leading-zero IDs, reference revisions from two forms, revise catalogs without changing existing forms, adopt revisions explicitly, retry idempotently, reject stale writers/forged option copies, and isolate tenant/application catalogs. Verify refresh and catalog administration preserve unsaved form edits. Browser suite: `dcp-value-sets.mjs` with isolated synthetic API.

## DCP-04 — CSV option staging

In Manage value sets, upload UTF-8 CSV, map distinct ID/label columns, review rows and apply them before saving the complete revision. Preserve leading-zero IDs and quoted commas. Duplicate IDs, blank values, editor delimiters, malformed headers and more than 50 rows must block import without changing the catalog. File selection must block saving previous options until staging is applied/canceled. Unsaved host form values remain intact. Check read-only disabling, discard prompts and retry behavior through the shared catalog tests. Browser coverage: `dcp-csv-options.mjs`; mapping/parser and catalog manager unit coverage supplement it. Native executable and native-speaker acceptance are separate.

## DCP-05 — Rules, releases and entity runtime

Verify integer 0–10 endpoints and rejection of fractions/out-of-range values, uppercase normalization versus uppercase-only validation, cyclic conditions/calculations, pinned published schemas and server-recomputed derived values. Check review/reject/approve/publish/retire transitions, required reasons, draft edit locks, new drafts preserving old releases, tenant/application and owner-type isolation, shared owner answers, expected revisions, idempotent submit and submitted read-only state. Exercise tab/step error navigation and conditional fields through the shared renderer. Import XLSX including leading-zero IDs, more than fifty rows, paged preview and formula rejection. Browser suite: `dcp-enterprise.mjs`. Host codec tests verify request mapping, response validation and structured errors; they do not establish a production connection. Native execution, actual backend/database/device and large-workload acceptance remain separate.


## DCP-06 — Backend v1 runtime and shared recovery

Load the backend-supplied v1 fixture through the public authenticated adapter. Preserve exact string revisions (including values above JavaScript's safe integer range); reject unsupported runtime metadata and unsafe numbers. Verify required Boolean false is present, omitted values retain stored data, explicit null clears, and row-specific permissions filter patches. New collection rows must omit local UI identity in requests. Preview and a 422 save response display validation without confirming persistence or losing permitted edits. Save increments the authoritative revision; a 409/uncertain failure requires an explicit reload decision and is never automatically retried. StrictMode/remount cancellation must not leave loading stuck or expose a previous scope. Shared recovery retains only writable values, verifies schema checksum/revision before restoration, and surfaces only authorized metadata in Draft Center. Evidence uses synthetic demo fixtures and Chromium; production HTTP/PostgreSQL/native acceptance is separate.

## DCP-07 — Multi-parent, presentation and repeatable authoring

Configure country plus entity type parents and verify conjunctive option filtering and descendant clearing. Translate field/section labels without changing stable IDs. Preview searchable, radio, segmented, toggle, range/rating and read-only presentation through shared controls. Add a repeatable section with minimum one/maximum two rows: rows retain independent inputs, add/remove limits hold, validation identifies the occurrence, calculations do not leak group values into the root, and CSV demo save/reload preserves normalized rows. Reject duplicate occurrence IDs, foreign field keys and dependencies from outside into a repeated occurrence. Changing a global parent clears affected values in every row. Copy a sample with rules and dependencies and verify all internal field references point to the copied fields.
