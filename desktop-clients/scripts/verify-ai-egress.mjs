/**
 * Nothing that identifies a person reaches a model vendor as typed.
 *
 * The sibling of verify:filter-safety, over the other consumer of the same
 * registry. That one asks "may this appear in a URL"; this one asks "must this
 * be masked before egress", and the realistic failure is the same shape: a use
 * case added next month names a field nobody classified, and an unclassified
 * key is masked — safe, but it silently empties a field the use case needs, and
 * the first person to notice is whoever wonders why the answer is vague.
 *
 * The other half is louder and worse: a GENERAL use case that reads a clinical
 * or identifying key. Those run without the named-record confirmation and under
 * the ordinary retention class, so the gate that is supposed to govern PHI is
 * simply not in the path. That check has nothing to do with redaction and would
 * not be caught by it.
 *
 * Runs the REAL modules through Node's type stripping, so there is no second
 * copy of the rule to drift from the one that ships.
