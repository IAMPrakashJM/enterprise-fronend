/**
 * Every form control comes from one place.
 *
 * Text boxes and dropdowns already did — there has never been a raw <select> or
 * <textarea> outside ops-ui. Checkboxes, radios and file inputs did not: five
 * were written by hand across four files, with four different class strings for
 * the same control and not one of them carrying a focus ring, a disabled state
 * or a label association. Nothing noticed, because nothing was looking.
 *
 * This looks. It is a grep with a reason attached, which is all it needs to be:
 * the failure it prevents is somebody reaching for `<input type="checkbox">`
 * because they did not know there was a Checkbox, and the answer is to say so
 * at the moment they run the checks.
 *
 * The rule is about the LIBRARY BOUNDARY, not about the elements. Inside ops-ui
 * these tags are the implementation and must be there; outside it they are a
 * fifth copy of a control that already exists.
