/**
 * The palette for a piece of shell chrome — the sidebar rail or the header bar.
 *
 * It RE-POINTS the generic token names rather than introducing new ones, so
 * every `bg-[var(--surface)]` and `text-[var(--text-muted)]` already inside the
 * element resolves to this palette with no change to the markup. There is no
 * dark variant of either component to keep in sync with a light one.
 *
 * Nine values from two seeds. A theme declares `--sidebar-surface` and
 * `--sidebar-text` (plus a `-light` pair); the ratios here hold the
 * relationships that make a panel readable, and each is a mix of the chrome's
 * TEXT toward its SURFACE — which stays correct whether the text is
 * light-on-dark or dark-on-light, so one set of ratios serves both tones.
 *
 * Mixed toward the chrome's own surface rather than `transparent`, so every
 * derived value is opaque: a translucent one would composite against whatever
 * sits behind, which for the sidebar is the page it floats over.
 *
 * Returns undefined for "surface", which leaves the element on the page's own
 * tokens — the historical behaviour, and the cheapest possible no-op.
