/**
 * What a worklist may write to a file.
 *
 * The third policy reading the one registry, and its answer differs from the
 * other two because the destination does:
 *
 *   URL     nothing but `operational`, because a query string is copied into
 *           every log between the browser and the application and kept for
 *           months by things that are not the application.
 *   Egress  identifiers masked, clinical content left legible, because a model
 *           vendor needs the diagnosis to answer and never needs the name.
 *   File    almost everything, because a ward list with the names removed is
 *           not a ward list — and the person exporting is already authorised to
 *           read what is on the screen in front of them.
 *
 * So this policy is not mostly about refusing. A file is the one destination
 * the application cannot take back: no retention rule reaches it, no revocation
 * does, and nobody is asked again when it is forwarded. What that warrants is
 * that the user is TOLD what the file will contain and that the export is
 * recorded — the same shape as the transparency panel, for the same reason.
 *
 * Two classes are refused outright:
 *
 *   credential    a token in a spreadsheet is never legitimate.
 *   unclassified  the safe default, as everywhere else. A column nobody
 *                 classified is the one most likely to be new and least likely
 *                 to have been thought about, and a file is a poor place to
 *                 discover it. verify:export-safety fails on one, so the drop
 *                 is a decision rather than a surprise.
