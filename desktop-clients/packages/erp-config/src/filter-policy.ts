/**
 * Which filters may appear in a URL, and which may not.
 *
 * The classification is a property of WHAT a filter is, held once in the
 * registry, so no screen can decide that its patient name is fine in a query
 * string just this once. Same shape as the AI gates: a rule enforced in one
 * place rather than remembered in twenty.
 *
 * The reason it is an allowlist and not a denylist: a filter nobody classified
 * is the one most likely to be new and least likely to have been thought about,
 * so the default has to be "hold it back". A denylist defaults new fields into
 * the URL, which is the wrong way round for the only mistake that matters.
 *
 * What "outside the URL" is protecting against, once past TLS:
 *
 *   nginx access log · API gateway log · APM traces · OpenTelemetry spans
 *   ELK/OpenSearch · cloud provider logs · browser history · Referer headers
 *
 * None of those are the application, all of them see the request line, and most
 * of them keep it for months. HTTPS protects the wire and nothing after the
 * terminator.
