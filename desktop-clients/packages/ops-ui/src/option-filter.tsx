   row's background and a mark in that same colour would vanish on exactly the
   row a user looks at first. A color-mix rather than the flat --accent-soft
   token: that token is near-white in the light themes and reads as nothing
   behind 10px type, while a fixed percentage of --accent lands at the same
   perceptual strength whatever the row sits on. Text colour stays --text --
