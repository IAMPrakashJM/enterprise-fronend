/**
 * The last check before the request leaves.
 *
 * Redaction happens during assembly, and assembly is the only path that builds
 * a context today. This exists for the day that stops being true: a second
 * caller, a replayed audit body, a context stitched together by hand. Guarding
 * on the way out as well as on the way in is the same shape as the filter
 * policy, which is guarded on read AND on write for the same reason -- a rule
 * enforced in one place is a rule until someone adds a second place.
 *
 * It does not mask. Arriving here unredacted means assembly was bypassed, which
 * is a defect; masking it quietly would hide the defect AND make the panel a
 * lie, since the panel already showed the user the unmasked value.
