     They used to be rebuilt inside the same useMemo as `sources`, on [byOwner].
     Every publish therefore handed subscribers a new `publish`, and the effect
     in usePublishAiSources listed the whole context object in its deps: publish
     -> new context -> effect re-runs -> cleanup retracts -> new context ->
     publish, without end.

     Outside a navigation this was invisible. React bails out of re-rendering
     children whose element identity has not changed, so the page never
     re-rendered and the cycle stopped after one turn. During a Next App Router
     navigation the subtree IS re-rendered from a fresh payload, the bail-out no
     longer applies, and the loop starves the transition: the RSC payload
     arrives 200, nothing throws, and the URL simply never commits. */
