/**
 * Redaction, applied during assembly rather than at dispatch.
 *
 * The ordering is the point. If redaction ran on the way out, the transparency
 * panel would show one thing and the provider would receive another — in the
 * user's favour, but still a panel that does not describe the request. Running
 * it here means the panel renders the redacted value because that IS the value.
 *
 * Two decisions, taken by two different things:
 *
 *   WHETHER to mask — the classification registry, which is also what decides
 *                     whether a key may appear in a URL. One table, so a field
 *                     cannot be PHI to the filter policy and ordinary to this
 *                     one. It was exactly that, until this file started reading
 *                     it: the registry classified `patientName` as PHI and
 *                     nothing here matched the name, so it reached the provider
 *                     in full — along with the treating clinician and the
 *                     admission date, both of which a clinical use case reads.
 *
 *   HOW to mask     — the shape rules below, matched on the key. They also
 *                     serve as the fallback for a key the registry has never
 *                     heard of, because no table lists every field on every
 *                     future page and waving an unknown one through is the
 *                     wrong default.
 *
 * Clinical content is deliberately NOT masked. A use case that reads a
 * diagnosis exists to reason about the diagnosis; masking it makes the feature
 * pointless while protecting nobody, given that the person it belongs to is
 * masked. It is governed by the clinical gate and its named-record
 * confirmation, and it still may not be written to a URL.
 *
 * Matching is by NAME, never by content. A matcher that redacted by shape would
 * eventually redact a customer name that looks like an account number, and a
 * user who sees their own data mangled stops trusting the panel.
