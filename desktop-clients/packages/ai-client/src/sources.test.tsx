 * during an App Router transition the subtree re-renders from a fresh payload,
 * the bail-out no longer applies, and the URL simply never commits.

 * Restoring that bug does not fail these tests so much as end the run: the loop
 * is inside render(), so the process exhausts its heap before any assertion is
